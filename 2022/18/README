part1-1
    This was my first solution, very straight-forward but O(nÂ²). It's very
    brute-force, and a bit slow. But the data set is small enough that it
    still doesn't take very long, about 5 seconds on my 10+ year-old computer.

part1-2
    This was my next solution, almost the same but tries to be less clever in
    the loop and ends up being about twice as fast.

part1
    Came up with this while working on Part 2; it runs in 0.02s on my old
    machine, which is better than a 2 orders-of-magnitude improvement over the
    first solution!

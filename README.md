# adventofcode
This repository contains my Advent of Code submissions. I first attempted AoC in
2023. After completing all the exercises, i went back and worked through 2022,
then 2021, then 2020. And by that point, enough time had passed that it was time
for 2024 to start, which i worked on in real time. For the more trivial exercises
i tend to not comment much, but as they become harder i try to make the code more
comprehensible.
